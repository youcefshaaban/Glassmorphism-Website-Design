## What Is A Glassmorphism Design?

> Glassmorphism is a visual-design style that utilizes different levels of translucency to create depth and contrast between foreground and background elements, mimicking frosted glass. Typically, glassmorphic UI elements stand out when placed in front of gradients or complex backgrounds to accentuate depth
